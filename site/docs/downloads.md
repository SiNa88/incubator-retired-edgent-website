Official Apache Edgent releases are available for download from the ASF distribution site. A release consists of a source code bundle and a convenience binary bundle. See the table below for a release's download links.

If you just want to use Edgent, it is easiest to download and unpack a binary bundle. The bundle includes the release's javadoc. The javadoc is also accessible online. For more information, please refer to the [Getting started guide](edgent-getting-started)

A source bundle contains a README describing how to build the sources.

If you want to access the latest unreleased Edgent source or to contribute to the Edgent runtime development, use the [GitHub repository]({{  site.data.project.source_repository_mirror }}). You can also select a particular release version by release tag (e.g., 1.0.0-incubating). See README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md in the repository for more information.

See [community](community.html) for more information about contributing to Edgent development.
